# TORSO lamp

The TORSO lamp is an artwork LED lamp.
The white plastic cover is a semishell torso for hanging and presenting underwear.

It's designed to be wall mounted. It can also be mounted on the ceiling, if wished.
There are two (independend) light modules.
The main module is build with white LED COB modules. (I prefere WW/CW modules, to set color temperature.)
The background lighting is build with RGB LED COB modules.
The power supply needs to be a seperate power supply module. So the lamp doesn't need earthing.

## base plate

Made from stainless steel; 1.4301; 0.8 mm
Size is 480 x 770 mm (WxH)
The mounting ears give 25 mm space, after bending.
Mounting plates are designed, to fit the LED modules, power supply connector and buttons.
